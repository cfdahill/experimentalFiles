# experimentalFiles

Inside of npm-brcypt you will find the code used by me to figure out the hash and salting of passwords as well as calling back to them in the password.js.  The folder called projectPW has parts of the project copied and pasted into it as well as files created to make the password component integrated into the project.  This will let me work on the project files without pushing anything to my project repository that shouldn't get pushed.  The password components will then be copied and pasted into the project repository.
